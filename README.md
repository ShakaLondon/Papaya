# PAPAYA PILOT

### A hair and beauty review platform, inspired by TrustPilot.


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

#### This capstone project was the final module I completed at Strive School as part of the Full Stack Development course I completed, and is intended as a final exhibition of all the skills I have gained during my time at Strive School. This is the first project that I have completely conceptualised and executed by myself.

#### I created this project from start to finish, it is a review platform for hair and beauty projects, this is the front end repository for the project. The backend can be found at (https://github.com/ShakaLondon/Papaya-Backend). The project contains a home page, review pages and profile pages and is a work in progress, in the future I intend to add product pages and barcode functionality to search for products. I used ReactJS to create the project and connected it to mongoDB using ExpressJS. The project also uses JWT authentication to register and log in users and a REDUX store to hold user information and various app states across the app. Some elements of the project are connected but I am currently working on connecting all pages and improving navigation through the app, I am also working on connecting search bars to display information from the database.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODE, REACT, MONGODB, MONGOOSE and EXPRESS to create this app.

## AVAILABLE SCRIPTS

###### In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```

###### Runs the app in the development mode.
###### Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

###### The page will reload when you make changes.
###### You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm test```

###### Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
###### See the section about running tests for more information.

```npm run build```

###### Builds the app for production to the build folder.
###### It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

###### The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
###### Your app is ready to be deployed!

###### See the section about deployment for more information.

```npm run eject```

###### Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

###### If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

###### Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

###### You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
